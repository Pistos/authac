## Ramaze AuthAC Part ##


### Demo ###

To see AuthAC in action with example code, simply:

1. Edit src/model.rb appropriately for your database.
2. Run tables.sql on your database.
3. Run sample-data.sql on your database.
4. In your Ramaze application's main.rb: require 'part/auth-ac/auth-ac'
   Be sure to require the auth-ac part *after* setting and loading Ramaze
   configuration.  This allows the part to set its controller mapping
   properly.
5. Browse /auth .  For a development environment, this might be something
   like: http://localhost:7000/auth
