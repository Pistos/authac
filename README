## Ramaze AuthAC Part ##


### Installation ###

1. Copy conf/auth-ac.conf.sample to conf/auth-ac.conf.
2. Edit conf/auth-ac.conf appropriately for your database and settings needs.
3. Ensure the appropriate tables are in your database.  sql/tables.sql
   can run so as to have the minimum table structure needed.
4. In your Ramaze application's main.rb: require 'part/auth-ac/auth-ac'
   Be sure to require the auth-ac part *after* setting and loading Ramaze
   configuration.  This allows the part to set its controller mapping
   properly.


### Demo ###

To see AuthAC in action with example code, follow the above Installation
directions, and then:

1. Run sample-data.sql on your database.
2. Browse /auth/register .  For a development environment, this might be something
   like: http://localhost:7000/auth


### Customization ###

The material in template/ and src/controller/ are only examples.  Use them as
a base to create your own custom templates and controllers.  The controller
examples show how to use the helper methods to do authentication and access
control.
